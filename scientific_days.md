The scientific day will illustrate exciting neuroscience that can be done
with techniques such as those in nilearn. As the goal is to inspire and
sketch the future of nilearn, the talks are not restricted to studies
that have been performed using nilearn.

All talks will be hosted on Crowdcast and simultaneously [live-streamed on Youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU6BMAi2zOhNFnDkbdevmPw/live)
