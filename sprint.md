The sprint will be a community effort to work on nilearn: adding new
features, improving examples, documentations.

**Sprint infrastructure:**

* Technical discussions should take place on GitHub as usual to keep track of development and have open discussions.
* To create more dynamic time together (albeit remotely), we have created a [Nilearn-Dev-Days Discord room](https://discord.gg/bMBhb7w). You can find a quick introduction to the Discord platform at the end of this email.
* Important announcements will be made on both Discord "general" channel and [the dedicated Nilearn issue](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/2433).

**Daily organization:**

* To say hello and organize work, we will have two introductory meetings on Wednesday at 9:30a CET and 9:30a EDT. To share progress we will have another common session on Thursday 5:00p CET, 11a EDT. You can find all relevant events in [the sprint calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/b/3?cid=bmlsZWFybi5ldmVudHNAZ21haWwuY29t).
* We welcome all contributors to schedule discussions for specific topics of interest. These sessions should be announced with at least a few hours notice on both the GitHub issue and Discord room.
* We will consider the sprint hours to run roughly from 9:00a CET to 6:00p EDT. We do not expect anyone to attend all (or most !) of that time ! These are just the times when at least one current Nilearn core developer will be online to help with general questions and point towards available resources.

**An introduction to Discord:**

* Discord is a chat platform that allows for both voice and text communication.
* In the left panel, you can modify settings at the top (notifications, privacy...) and see all available channels below (text and voice)
* In the right panel you can see who is connected and contact them directly.
* The general channels will be for welcoming, general announcements, and asking general questions. A break channel is dedicated to sharing breaks together. You can create other channels to accommodate specific needs (for example, setting up your development environment).
* Notifications can be a bit overwhelming on Discord, don't hesitate to filter them out while working (muting channels with right-click or setting your account on Do Not Disturb).
