[Nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io) is a Python tool that has historically focused on statistical learning with volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data.
With the recent merge [Nistats](https://nistats.github.io),
the Nilearn mission statement has been expanded:

> Nilearn enables **approachable and versatile analyses of brain volumes**.
> It provides statistical and machine-learning tools, with **instructive documentation & a friendly community**.

In the 2020 Dev Days, we hope to **increase the awareness of Nilearn's development philosophy** and **onboard new contributors** to our community.
We also hope to **highlight future directions** where we are especially excited to see **community-driven development** efforts.
